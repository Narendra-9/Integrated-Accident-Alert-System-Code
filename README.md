# Integrated Accident Prevention System (IAPS)
## Abstract
In today's fast-paced world, road safety remains a critical concern, our project "Integrated Accident Prevention System" aims to 
enhance driver safety by employing advanced technologies to detect and mitigate potential risks on the road. This comprehensive 
system incorporates four key components: sleep detection, alcohol detection, automatic dipping of headlights. All these are 
integrated on Arduino UNO. The sleep detection feature utilizes sensors to monitor driver fatigue levels, issuing alerts when signs 
of drowsiness are detected, thereby prompting the driver to take necessary breaks or corrective actions. The alcohol detection 
mechanism employs sensors to analyse the driver's breath or touch, preventing the vehicle from starting if alcohol levels exceed 
safety thresholds, thus reducing the risk of impaired driving. Automatic dipping of headlights ensures optimal visibility for both the 
driver and oncoming vehicles by adjusting the intensity and direction of the headlights based on surrounding conditions, thereby 
minimizing glare and improving overall safety. By integrating these features into a cohesive system, our project endeavours to 
proactively mitigate the potential for accidents, thereby safeguarding the lives of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians alike, while 
promoting safer roadways for all.
## Description
The Integrated Accident Prevention System (IAPS) is an Arduino-based project designed to enhance road safety by monitoring driver fatigue, alcohol impairment, and headlight intensity.
